# Rephrase Assistant Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome extension (or web app) that allows users to input a sentence and choose a tone (e.g., professional, polite, friendly, etc.) to rephrase the sentence. The extension interacts with the Gemini API to rephrase the sentence and display the new version based on the chosen tone.

## Features

- **Input Sentence**: Users can enter a sentence they want to rephrase.
- **Select Tone**: Users can select from a variety of tones, such as:
  - Professional
  - Polite
  - Romantic
  - Friendly
  - Assertive
  - Sympathetic
  - Casual
  - Optimistic
  - Direct
  - Motivational
  - Empathetic
  - Formal
  - Inquisitive
  - Encouraging
  - Reassuring
- **Rephrase**: After selecting a tone, users can click the "Rephrase" button to get the sentence rephrased.
- **Output**: The rephrased sentence will appear in a text area.

## Prerequisites

- A web browser (e.g., Chrome) to run the extension or web app.
- **Gemini API key**: You will need an API key from Gemini (or any other compatible AI language model API) to make the rephrasing requests.
